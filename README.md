# CS49---FOOTHILL
Repository of projects from the class CS49 - FOOTHILL
I am taking CS49 in foothill college, this is the repository of my python programming adventure. My instructor is Lane Johnson. I will be posting my projects for this class here.
Each project will have its own folder, where you will find sub-folders that contain a:


_README file that contains the description of what we want to achieve with our project_

_"Name of the project" file that contains the code used to solve the project_
