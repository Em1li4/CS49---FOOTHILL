Create a 20 second hand washing timer.  The user should choose a color, which will be displayed on all pixels during the 20 seconds.  There should be a default (different) color in case the user does not pick a valid color.  When the timer is done, beep a few times to let the user know that they have finished hand washing!

For an extra challenge, have each light change color in two second increments, where the user may choose that color as well, and, if they provide an invalid color, have a different default color on the ready in that case. 

And for an extra extra challenge, see if you can teach your Bluefruit to play a song when the timer is finished!
