Write a program that starts up your Bluefruit device with pixel #0 lit up, use whatever color you like. Then, if the user pushes your Bluefruit's "A" button, the light should move one pixel in the counterclockwise direction. If the user pushes your Bluefruit's "B" button instead, the light should move one pixel in the clockwise direction. The user should be able to keep pressing either button, and the light should continue to circle around. Now, the user should only push either button A or button B. If the user pushes both at the same time, have your Bluefruit make a noise to let the user know they blew it.
